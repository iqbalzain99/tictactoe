## Game Notes

- Grid size currently limited to 3-10 for performance reasons.
- First player is always Player 1 when initializing a new game.
- Player 2 can move first if the last player who moved on the previous player is Player 1.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Project Notes:

- Make sure both backend and frontend are running simultaneously for full functionality.
  The frontend will automatically connect to the backend running on localhost:8080.
- Since the project is for assess my backend, and I lack of experience of the frontend. I asked DeepSeek üêã to help me tidy up my previously functioning code can be accessed at `./react-tic_tac_toe/src/components/DynamicGrid.jsx`, the result is on `./react-tic_tac_toe/src/components/ImprovedGrid.jsx`
